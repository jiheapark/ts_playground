  Value in range from progress

  that range as expressed by progress (a number from 0-1)

  @param [number]: Lower limit of range
  @param [number]: Upper limit of range
  @param [number]: The progress between lower and upper limits expressed 0-1
  @return [number]: Value as calculated from progress within range (not limited within range)
