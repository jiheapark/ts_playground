        <p class="grid-lines">Grid lines are the horizontal and vertical dividing lines of the grid. A grid line exists on either side of a column
            or row. They can be referred to by numerical index, or by an author-specified name. A grid item references the
            grid lines to determine its position within the grid using the grid-placement properties.</p>
